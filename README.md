# Kendo UI Plugins

## About Kendo Plugins

Kendo Plugins is a library of third party widgets and controls written for Kendo UI by the community.

## Compatibility and Requirements

Kendo Plugins depend on **AT LEAST** the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.8.2
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) vCurrent

Additionally, some plugins have other required resources

* **maps:** Requires the [Google Maps API library V3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)

Kendo Plugins has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with angular-kendo, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

## Source Code and Downloads

Each plugin folder contains a JavaScript file which contains the respective Kendo UI Widget.
